Initial Test Files: These programs are in no way supposed to be reflective of the final program. They were created to prove if 
		    certain things could be done using my limited knowledge of Python.
Please note that
	-Many are incomplete
	-Missing test cases
	-contain partially working or broken functions
	-Functions may be inefficient

To Run:
	1) Download and place in a single folder
	2) Run SQL_shell
	3) Send commands to the SQL_shell as you would a database
	*for added efficience run a shortcut from the desktop to SQL_shell.

Future Updates:
	The SQL_Emulator will be split into two files:
		1) The database
		2) The parser
